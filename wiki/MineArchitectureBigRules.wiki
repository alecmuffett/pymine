#summary Big Rules For Mine Development Software Architecture
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

= Overall =
  * if it's not yours, it's not a mine
     * only you get to decide what "yours" means
  * the subscriber gets what you choose to give them, and nothing more
    * subscribers do not "take", they are "given"

= Architecture=
  # invent nothing
  # content neutral
  # platform neutral
  # no magical protocols
  # no magical data formats
  # no external service dependencies
  # "transport secrecy" is out of scope
  # "transport authentication" is out of scope
  # "discovery" is not merely out of scope, it is antithetical

= Development =
  # no premature optimisation
    * ...includes "not solving problems before you have them"
  # no burden on the subscriber that cannot be addressed by vanilla firefox
    * ...by which we do not include "use a plugin"
