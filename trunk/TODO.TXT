feed generation logic:

# where X = the union of tag.cloud for each tag in relation.tags
# the feed comprises:
# (
# all postings marked for:relation
# so long as they are public or shared
# +
# all postings tagged FOO where FOO is in X 
# so long as they are public
# )
# distinct
# excluding any marked not:relation
# excluding any that are currently hidden
# sorted by most recently modified


todo:

- break out vanity urls model into /get?
- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment
- pagination
- extended attributes
- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 

	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere

  ...these are the same problem

- add s2m methods to model so that vurlLink gets stripped of whitespace.
- fix sattr deletion in the model
- what to do about relationship PKs being reusable?  ban deletion of Relations?
