todo:

- break out vanity urls model into /get?

- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment

- pagination

- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 
	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere
  ...these are the same problem

- add s2m methods to model so that vurlLink gets stripped of whitespace.

- fix sattr deletion in the model

- what to do about relationship PKs being reusable?  
  ban deletion of Relations?
  boolean mark Relations as deleted/inactivated?

- leverage Vurls to create mechanism for Item in Mine to insert
  third-party IRL into list of feed permalinks; first step towards
  distributed mine, and allows your feed to contain references to
  third-party objects

- extra Item sattrs:
	itemFeedBody(required=False) - what gets put into the feed body
	itemFeedPermalink(required=False) - what gets put into feed permalink
