todo soon:

- add field to LogEvent to break-out RID info

- implement _fakedatafile HTTP stuff

- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment

- pagination

- add s2m methods to model so that vurlLink gets stripped of whitespace.

- fix sattr deletion in the model



todo after:

- what to do about relationship PKs being reusable?  
  ban deletion of Relations?
  boolean mark Relations as deleted/inactivated?



todo longer:

- break out vanity urls model into /get?

- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 
	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere
  ...these are the same problem


- leverage Vurls to create mechanism for Item in Mine to insert
  third-party IRL into list of feed permalinks; first step towards
  distributed mine, and allows your feed to contain references to
  third-party objects
