todo soon:

-- get VURL to handle HEAD sensibly


- hack a delete_for_real into the AbstractModel, and override delete()
  in the subclasses to do sensible garbage collection.

- if updating an itemData, delete the old one.

- add relation_feed_url() method to Relation()

- put URL for item-zero-comments into feed-description-html

- break the feed-generation SQL query out into a "search" subdiretory and put the other search code in there too?

- pack out the individual items in the list results with useful metainfo

- add field to LogEvent to break-out RID info

- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment

- pagination

- add s2m methods to model so that vurlLink gets stripped of whitespace.

- fix sattr deletion in the model

- fix the abstractfield factory argument parser for the file() field

todo after:

- what to do about relationship PKs being reusable?  
  ban deletion of Relations?
  boolean mark Relations as deleted/inactivated?


todo longer:

- break out vanity urls model into /get?
- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 
	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere
  ...these are the same problem
- leverage Vurls to create mechanism for Item in Mine to insert
  third-party IRL into list of feed permalinks; first step towards
  distributed mine, and allows your feed to contain references to
  third-party objects
