url hierarchy:
	/ - root
	/pub - public documents

	/api - REST api

	/ui - HTML user interface

	/get - minekey access 
	/r - redirection / tinyvurl (implemented in get.*)
	/v - long vanity urls (implemented in get.*)

	/ie - import/export



- break out vanity urls model into /get?

- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment

- extended attributes

- pagination

- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 
	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere
  ...these are the same problem
