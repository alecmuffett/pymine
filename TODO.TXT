- break out vanity urls model into /get?

- allow comments on 0bject zero, by permitting NULL value for IID in Comment

- pagination

- extended attributes

- hack gen-django-code.pl so that 
	1) the IID==0 regexp is restricted to pertinent URLs
	2) FMT for SATTRs can include "raw", different to FMT elsewhere
  ...these are the same problem


- add s2m methods to model so that vurlLink gets stripped of whitespace.

- fix sattr deletion in the model

- what to do about relationship PKs being reusable?  ban deletion of Relations?
