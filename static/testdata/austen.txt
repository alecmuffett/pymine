IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a man in possession of a
good fortune must be in need of a wife.  However little known the
feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a
neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the the minds of the
surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.
